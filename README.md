## Hello World!

- My name is Takeshi.
- I'm 15 years old.
- Python, CSS3, HTML5 and GML.
- I like being creative and being able to express my creativity with concepts and coding skills.
- I am a huge retro-gaming fan, and i like to dig into lost Sonic The Hedgehog media / game data, plus i was used to modding Sonic Mania.
- Most of my repositories will be in Brazilian Portuguese because this github profile is (mostly) for my school projects. (And Team projects too.)
